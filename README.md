# LewisAR
An Augmented Reality Project for the MIT Libraries

Experience the John Harbison canon in the Lewis Music Library in a completely new way. 
Open the app, point your phone at the murals hanging off the mezzanine balcony, and see the canon play in front of your eyes.


This project is built with Unity3D and Vuforia, uses a recording of the John Harbison Canon, and includes other visual 
assets for murals and animations. These are included in this github repo.

If you're helping beta test, awesome! Please send an email to kakobh@mit.edu about your participation so we can send you the build. Please help us make sure that all the buttons take you to where they say they will, and that the animation and music sync up when using the AR portion of the app. 

Our plan is to upload the app to the iOS app store ourselves, and MIT's IS&T will handle uploading the app to the Google Play Store.
